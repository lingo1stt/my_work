## Introduction to my_work directory
This directory was created by Steven Lin to store a collection of works written in various programming languages. Each script serves a unique function and can be applied in the field of bioinformatics. It includes scripts written in languages such as Linux, Perl, and R： <br>
### -Linux
This folder contains three .sh executable files, whose main functions are to perform quality control, alignment, and variant calling steps in the NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) variant calling process within a Linux environment. <br>
### -Perl
In the Perl folder, there are several custom scripts that can be executed in Perl to perform feature analysis on FASTA files, including tasks such as calculating GC content, running BLAST, generating reverse complement sequences, and more. <br>

### -R
This folder contains several R scripts showing how to visualize data with ggplot2, and some customized functions dealing with bioformatic-related data.<br>
